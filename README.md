👋 Hi, I'm @mark-matos

👀 I'm a passionate Cyber Security enthusiast with a keen interest in threat analysis, incident response, and all things related to Security Operations Centers (SOCs). My journey in the realm of cybersecurity is driven by the pursuit of making the digital world a safer place for everyone.

🌱 Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in malware analysis, penetration testing, and security information and event management (SIEM) tools. I thrive on continuous learning, exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity, and staying updated on evolving threats.

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, particularly those involving SOC operations, threat intelligence, and security research. I believe in the power of collective knowledge and collaborative efforts to strengthen our defense against cyber threats.

📫 You can reach me at my email mark.matos2294@gmail.com or my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/markmatos2/. I'm always open to discussions, networking, and sharing insights with fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts.

🇬🇷 Fun fact: When not immersed in the world of cybersecurity, you'll find me hiking/camping in the mountains or in Greece with my family.

Let's connect and build a more secure digital future together! 🛡️💻
